//! Query loop seam.

//! it asks a [`QueryDeps`](crate::query::deps::QueryDeps) implementation for
//! source-level query events and maps those events into `RenderableMessage` rows at this
//! seam. The production path now enters model streaming through
//! [`QueryDeps::call_model`](crate::query::deps::QueryDeps::call_model),
//! mirroring the official `deps.callModel` dependency seam; accepted typed
//! events persist through the official-shaped sessionStorage `Project` boundary.
